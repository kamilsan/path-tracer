# Path tracer
Monte Carlo path tracer capable of rendering scenes with multiple light sources (including area lights) and diffuse objects. It implements some techniques to reduce noise, such as stratified and importance sampling. For some reason I wrote it whole in one file.

Example render (24 BRDF and 16 area light samples):
